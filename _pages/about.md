I am currently a first-year Ph.D. in the Department of Industrial Engineering & Management Sciences at Northwestern University.

Till May 2024, I was in the Joint Bachelor’s Degree Program between City University of Hong Kong and Columbia University. I received my B.A. in Mathematics-Statistics from Coulmbia and B.Sc. in Computing Mathematics in CityU.

I am broadly interested in developing theory and methods for statistics, machine learning, probability and stochastics.
